# Description: Products > Jukito > description
C96F7FF29D16F1B36A19D452AA5F138F=Jukito is a tool that facilitates the development for quality control of a web application, which minimizes the number of bugs and so reduce development costs and maintenance. This product, specifically designed for programmers, is the bridge between three practices recognized as essential to a quality development process: reverse dependencies, the mocking and unit testing. Jukito complements your testing infrastructure by letting you rely on the power of dependency injection directly in your tests. Jukito''s auto-mocking mechanism will dramatically reduce the size of your test classes, leading to tests that are both more reasable and easier to maintain. Jukito is a very light-weight addition to your testing infrastructure and its use can easily be combined with other testing technologies. It is therefore easy to adopt Jukito midway through a project, letting you gradually simplify your testing code.
