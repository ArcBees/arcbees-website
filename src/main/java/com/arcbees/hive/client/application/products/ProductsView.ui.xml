                Model-View-Presenter for the Google Web
                Toolkit (GWT). This platform
                ensures that your application with GWT will be built to best industry practices while accelerating the
                development of web applications, which is particularly useful for ensuring quality and maintainability
                oflarge-scale web application. GWT-Platform is composed of different modules including the MVP framework
                itself, a command pattern module, a service to make modern webapps crawlable by search engines, and
                tools to
                help with various facets of GWT project developement.This open source framework, introduced by ArcBees
                in
                early 2010, has grown rapidly thanks to itswidespread
                adoption. His explosive popularity led ArcBees to present it to the prestigious Google I / O in 2011.

            <ui:msg description="Products > Jukito > description">Jukito complements your testing infrastructure by
                letting you rely on the power of
                dependency injection
                directly in your tests. Jukito's auto-mocking mechanism will dramatically reduce the size of your test
                classes, leading to tests that are both more reasable and easier to maintain. Jukito is a very
                light-weight
                addition to your testing infrastructure and its use can easily be combined with other testing
                technologies.
                It is therefore easy to adopt Jukito midway through a project, letting you gradually simplify your
                testing
                code.
