# Description: Home - Bees - text
80085C7DC2C5266E8821444624B3C7D9=<p> <strong>You can’t beat bees for efficiency.</strong> </p> <p>Their hexagonal honeycombs are the most economical structure for packing a surface. It gives them the most storage for the lowest resource cost mathematically possible. </p> <p>Each type of bee is an expert at its job, but at a signal from the queen the whole hive can mobilize and move. Bees work hard. When a team is fully engaged in a project, we say they’re “as busy as bees”. But the busyness of bees relies on the integrity of the hive. </p> <p>We want to help developers generate the structure and coordinate their efforts as efficiently as bees, so that they can concentrate on what they do best, and consistently enjoy the sweet, sweet honey of their own success. </p>
